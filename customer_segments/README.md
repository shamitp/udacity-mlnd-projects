# Creating Customer Segments Project
The goal of this project is to use unsupervised learning to group customers into segments based on their annual
spending amounts for diverse product categories. In this project, I learned how to apply dimensionality reduction
and clustering to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts
with, so that the distributor can gain insight into how to best organize their delivery service to meet the needs of each 
customer. 

## Usage
This project can be viewed as either an IPython Notebook (customer_segments.ipynb) or an HTML file (report.html).

## Tools
The tools I used in this project were Python, pandas, and numpy.
