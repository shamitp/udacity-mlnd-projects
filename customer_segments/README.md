This is my submission for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Creating Customer Segments project.
The goal of this project is to use unsupervised learning to group customers into segments based on their annual
spending amounts for diverse product categories. The purpose of this project is to learn how to apply
dimensionality reduction and clustering to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that
a wholesale distributor interacts with, so that the distributor can gain insight into how to best organize their
delivery service to meet the needs of each customer. The tools I used in this project were Python, pandas, and numpy.
