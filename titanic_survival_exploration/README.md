# Titanic Survival Exploration Project
The goal of this project is to explore a subset of the RMS Titanic passenger manifest to determine what features
best predict someone's survival. In this project, I learned how to do exploratory data analysis using Python.

## Usage
This project can be viewed as either an IPython Notebook (titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb) or HTML file (report.html).

## Tools
The tools I used in this project were Python, pandas, and numpy.
