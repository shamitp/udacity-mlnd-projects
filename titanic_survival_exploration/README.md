This is my submission for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree titanic_survival_exploration project.
The goal of this project is to explore a subset of the RMS Titanic passenger manifest to determine what features
best predict someone's survival. The purpose of this project is to understand how to do exploratory data analysis
using Python. The tools I used in this project were Python, pandas, numpy, and visuals.
