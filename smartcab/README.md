# Smartcab Project
The goal of this project is to train a Smartcab to reach its destination safely and efficiently 
using reinforcement learning. In this project, I learned how reinforcement learning can be used in 
a real-world context and how feasible it would be in such an environment.

## Usage
This project can be viewed as either an IPython Notebook (smartcab.ipynb) or HTML file (report.html).

## Tools
The tools I used in this project are Python, PyGame, and matplotlib.
