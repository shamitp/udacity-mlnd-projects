This is my submission for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree smartcab project.
The goal of this project is to train a Smartcab to reach its destination safely and efficiently 
using reinforcement learning. The purpose of this project is to understand how reinforcement
learning can be used in a real-world context, and we expect to learn how feasible it would be
in such an environment. The tools I used in this project are Python, PyGame, and matplotlib.
