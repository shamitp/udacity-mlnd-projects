This is my submission for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Finding Donors for CharityML project.
The goal of this project is to use several supervised learning algorithms to accurately model individuals' income
using 1994 U.S. Census data. The purpose of this project is to learn how to apply supervised learning in a real-
world context and understand the strengths and weaknesses of different supervised learning algorithms. The tools
I used in this project were Python, pandas, and numpy.
