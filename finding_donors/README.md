# Finding Donors Project
The goal of this project is to use several supervised learning algorithms to accurately model individuals' income
using 1994 U.S. Census data. In this project, I learned how to apply supervised learning in a real-world context and
understand the strengths and weaknesses of different supervised learning algorithms.

## Usage
This project can be viewed as either an IPython Notebook (finding_donors.ipynb) or an HTML file (report.html).

## Tools
The tools I used in this project were Python, pandas, and numpy.
