# Boston Housing Prices Prediction Project
The goal of this project is to evaluate the performance and predictive ability of a model that has been trained and
tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, MA. In this project, I learned how to do
model evaluation and validation.

## Usage
This project can be viewed as either an IPython Notebook (boston_housing.ipynb) or HTML file (report.html).

## Tools
The tools I used in this project were Python, pandas, numpy, and sklearn.
