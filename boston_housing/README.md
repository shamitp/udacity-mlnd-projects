This is my submission for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Boston Housing Prices Prediction project.
The goal of this project is to evaluate the performance and predictive ability of a model that has been trained and
tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, MA. The purpose of this project is to learn how to do
model evaluation and validation. The tools I used in this project were Python, pandas, numpy, and sklearn.
