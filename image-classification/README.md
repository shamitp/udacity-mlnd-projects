This is my submission for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree image classification project.
The goal of this project is to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) that will classify images in one
of ten categories. The purpose of this project is to understand how to implement a CNN in TensorFlow and
how tweaking various hyperparameters and the network architecture affects classification performance.
The tools I used in this project were Python, TensorFlow, numpy, and sklearn.
