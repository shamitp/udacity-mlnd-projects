# Image Classification Project
The goal of this project is to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) that will classify images in one
of ten categories. In this project, I learned how to implement a CNN in TensorFlow and how tweaking various
hyperparameters and the network architecture affects classification performance.

## Usage
This project can be viewed as either an IPython Notebook (image_classification.ipynb) or HTML file (report.html).

## Tools
The tools I used in this project were Python, TensorFlow, numpy, and sklearn.
