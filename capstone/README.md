# Capstone Project
The goal and purpose of this project is to put together what I've learned in this program to solve a real-world problem using machine learning techniques. Specifically, I explored how well different linear and nonlinear regression techniques could predict the log-error between Zillow's estimate of a home price and the actual sale price. I found that the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit model performed best according to the Mean Absolute Error evaluation metric.

## Software Used
- capstone.py - Main code for the project that runs all the regression models
- visuals.py - Supplementary visualization code from Udacity (modified slightly for this project)

## Supporting Material
All datasets for this project can be obtained from the Kaggle Zillow Prize Competition Data webpage:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/data

## Usage
1. Ensure that you have all required datasets for this project (described in report.pdf)
2. To run the main project code: `python capstone.py`

## Tools
The tools used in this project were Python, numpy, pandas, sklearn, and matplotlib.
