Description:
This is my submission for the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Capstone project. The goal and purpose of 
this project is to put together what I've learned in this program to solve a real-world problem using machine learning 
techniques. The tools used in this project were Python, numpy, pandas, sklearn, and matplotlib.

Software Used:
capstone.py - Main code for the project that runs all the regression models,
visuals.py - Supplementary visualization code from Udacity (modified slightly for this project)

Supporting Material:
All datasets for this project can be obtained from the Kaggle Zillow Prize Competition Data webpage:
